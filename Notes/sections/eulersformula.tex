\section{Euler's Formula}
One of the most famous equations in maths was discovered by Leonhard Euler. In it, he ties together \(i,\pi \text{ and } e\).

He found that any complex number \(z=r(\cos{\theta}+i\sin{\theta})\) could be written in the form \(z=re^{i\theta}\).

This means that \(e^{i\theta}=\cos{\theta}+i\sin{\theta}\), where \(\theta\) is the argument in radians of the complex number. Since the argument is the rotation about the origin, it leads to the most famous result, called Euler's Identity:

\[e^{i\pi}=-1\]

Euler's Formula is often referred to as polar form at university, and makes it similarly easy for us to solve problems involving complex numbers.

\textbf{For example:}

\(2e^{2i} \times 3e^{5i}=6e^{7i}\)

\(e^{2i} \div e^{3i}=e^{-i}\)

If you have to change from rectangular into polar form:

If \(z=1-i\), find \(z^7\).

\(|1-i|=\sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2}=\sqrt{2}\)

\(arg(1-i)=-\frac{\pi}{4}\)

Hence, \(z=\sqrt{2}e^{-\frac{i\pi }{4}}\)

\(z^7=(\sqrt{2})^7 e^{-\frac{7i\pi}{4}}\)

\(z^7=2^{\frac{7}{2}}e^{\frac{i\pi}{4}}\)

\textbf{A harder example:}

Find the value of \(i^i\)

Since we know that \(i=e^{\frac{i\pi}{2}}\), as it is only a revolution of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) radians to get to the imaginary axis, we can rewrite the expression as \(i^i=e^{(\frac{i\pi}{2})^{i}}\)

Then, using power rules, we simply multiply the powers together:

\(i^i=e^{\frac{i^2\pi}{2}}=e^{-\frac{\pi}{2}}=-i\)
