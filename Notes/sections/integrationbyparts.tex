\section{Integration by parts}
There are some products that cannot be integrated by the reverse chain rule or by substitution. For these, we use a technique called 'integration by parts', which is just the product rule in reverse. It is used when integrating the product of a function and the derivative of another function.

To see where this technique comes from, consider the product rule where we differentiate the product of two functions, \textit{u} and \textit{v}:

\(\frac{d}{dx}uv=u'v + v'u\)

If we integrate both sides with respect to \textit{x}:

\(\int \frac{d}{dx}uv\,dx=\int (u'v + v'u)\,dx\)

Since integration undoes differentiation and integrals can be split across sums, we can rewrite this as:

\(uv=\int u'v\,dx + \int v'u\,dx\,dx\)

Rearranging this, we get the formula for integration by parts:

\[\int uv'\,dx\,dx = uv - \int u'v\,dx\]

You may sometimes see this written as:

\[\int u \,dv=uv-\int v \, du\]

For example, evaluate the integral \(\int x \sin{x} \, dx\)

We would choose \(u=x\) as this differentiates to a constant, so \(du = 1\).

This also means that \(dv=\sin{x}\)

Integrating \(dv\), we get \(v=-\cos{x}\)

Therefore, the integral is:

$
\!
\begin{aligned}
    \int x \sin{x} \, dx
    &=-x\cos{x}- \int -\cos{x} \, dx\\
    &=-x\cos{x} + \int \cos{x} \, dx\\
    &=-x\cos{x}+\sin{x}+c\\
\end{aligned}
$

Another example:

\(\int x \ln{x} \,dx\)

In this example, note that we don't know how to easily integrate \(\ln{x}\), so we are best to choose \(u=\ln{x}\) and \(dv=x\).

Therefore:

\(du=\frac{1}{x}\) and \(v=\frac{x^2}{2}\)

Substituting into our equation for integration by parts:

$
\!
\begin{aligned}
    \int x\ln{x}\, dx
    &= \frac{x^2}{2}\ln{x}-\int \frac{x^2}{2}\times \frac{1}{x}\, dx\\
    &=\frac{x^2}{2}\ln{x}-\int \frac{x}{2}\, dx\\
    &=\frac{x^2}{2}\ln{x}-\frac{x^2}{4}+c
\end{aligned}
$
