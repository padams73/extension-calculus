\section{Volumes of revolution}
To understand volumes of revolution, we should start by going back to how definite integration works.

Consider a definite integral for a function $f(x)$ that calculates the area between the function and the $x$-axis, between $x=a$ and $x=b$:

\[\int_a^b f(x)\, dx\]

If we look at this graphically, we can see that this area is made up of infinitely small rectangles:

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/volrev1.png}
\end{figure}

When you consider what the definite integral is saying, the height of each rectangle is $f(x)$, and the width is $dx$. The integral symbol ($\int$) is just an abbreviation of sum, so we are effectively saying find the sum of areas of an infinite number of small rectangles, each of which has area of $f(x)\times dx$.

\subsection*{Disc method}
When we rotate a function about an axis, we can calculate the volume of the shape formed. Visualising the rotation below (this one is about the $x$-axis).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{images/volrev2.png}
\end{figure}

Notice that the rotation is circular, meaning that our 3D shape is made up of an infinite number of infinitely thin circular prisms (cylinders).
    
The volume of a cylinder is $\pi r^2h$. In our case, the radius of each circle is the value of the function, $f(x)$. Again, the height of each cylinder is $dx$. To find the volume we need to do another sum of infinite values, meaning another definite integral.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/volrev3.png}
\end{figure}

In this case, our sum will be $\int_a^b \pi r^2 dx = \int_a^b \pi (f(x))^2\,dx = \pi \int_a^b (f(x))^2\,dx$

If the rotation is around the $y$-axis, we can simply rearrange the equation so that $x$ is the subject.

i.e. $\int_a^b \pi (f(y))^2\,dy$

\subsection*{Example}
Find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by $y=0.1x^2$ and the $x$-axis between $x=2$ and $x=4$ around the $x$-axis.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/volrev4.png}
\end{figure}

$V=\pi \int_2^4 (0.1x^2)^2\,dx = \pi \int_2^4 0.01x^4\,dx$

$V=\pi[0.002x^5]_2^4=6.23$

\subsection*{Washer method}
If the area between two functions is rotated around an axis, we use the washer method to find the volume. (A washer is just a disc with a hole in the centre of it.)

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{images/volrev5.png}
\end{figure}

The area of a washer with outer radius of $R$ and inner radius of $r$ is $\pi R^2-\pi r^2=\pi(R^2 - r^2)$

Therefore, the volume of an infinite number of tiny washers between $x=a$ and $x=b$ will be:

$V=\int_a^b \pi (R^2 - r^2)\,dx$

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{images/volrev6.png}
\end{figure}

If the outer function is $f(x)$ and the inner function is $g(x)$, then the volume will be:

$\pi \int_a^b (f(x))^2 - (g(x))^2\,dx$
\pagebreak
\subsection*{Example}
Calculate the volume of the solid generated by revolving the area bounded by:
 $y=x+4$ and $y=x^2+2$ about the x-axis.

You will need to find the points of intersection to get the upper and lower limits of the definite integral.

$x^2+2=x+4\\
x^2-x-2=0\\
x=-1, 2$

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{images/volrev7.png}
\end{figure}

$V=\pi \int_{-1}^2 (x+4)^2 - (x^2+2)^2\,dx$

$V=\pi \int_{-1}^2 (x^2+8x+16) - (x^4+4x^2+4)\,dx$

$V=\pi \int_{-1}^2 (-x^4-4x^2+8x+12)\,dx$

$V=\pi \Bigl[-\frac{x^5}{5}-\frac{4x^3}{3}+4x+12x\Bigr]_{-1}^2$

$V=\pi \Bigl[\frac{128}{5}-\frac{-34}{5} \Bigr]=\frac{162\pi}{5}$

\subsection*{Different axis of rotation}
When the axis of rotation is different from the $x$ or $y$-axis, we just shift the function across so that the axis of rotation is returned to one of those axes.

For example, if we rotate the function $y=x^2$ about the line $y=1$, we need to move the function down 1 so that the axis of rotation returns to the $x$-axis, so it becomes $y=x^2-1$.

This means our definite integral will look like:

$\pi \int_a^b (x^2-1)^2\,dx$
