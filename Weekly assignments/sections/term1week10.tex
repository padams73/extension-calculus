    \item 
    A water tank is full of water. It has three outlet pipes, each having a constant drainage rate. Let a, b and c be labels for the outlet pipes.\\
    
    If a and b are both turned on, they take 12 hours to drain the tank.\\
    If a and c are both turned on, they take 15 hours to drain the tank.\\
    If b and c are both turned on, they take 20 hours to drain the tank.\\
    
    How long would each outlet pipe take to drain the water tank if they were opened individually?
