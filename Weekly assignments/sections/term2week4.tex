\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    Suppose P(x) is a cubic polynomial such that P\((\sqrt{5})=5\) and P\((^3\sqrt{5})=5 ^3\sqrt{5}\).\\

    Compute P(5)\\

    \item 
    Calculate the sum of all positive integers n for which the expression \(\frac{n+7}{\sqrt{n-1}}\) is an integer.\\

    \item 
    Ava and Tiffany participate in a knockout tournament consisting of 32 players. In each of 5 rounds, the remaining players are paired uniformly at random. In each pair, both players are equally likely to win, and the loser is knocked out of the tournament. \\

    The probability that Ava and Tiffany play each other during the tournament is \(\frac{a}{b}\), where \textit{a} and \textit{b} are relatively prime positive integers. Calculate \textit{100a+b}.\\

    \item 
    Let P\((x)=x^3+x^2-r^2x-2024\) be a polynomial with roots \textit{r,s} and \textit{t}. What is the value of P(1)?
