    \item 
    A building has an external elevator. The elevator is raising at a constant rate of \(3 ms^{-1} \).\\
    Sarah is stationary, watching the elevator from a point 25m away from the base of the elevator shaft.\\

    Find the rate at which \(\theta\), the angle of elevation, is increasing when the elevator floor is 10m above Sarahâ€™s eye level.
    \item 
    When a conical bottle rests on its flat base, the water in the bottle is 8 cm from its vertex.\\
    When the same conical bottle is turned upside down, the water level is 2 cm from its base.\\
    What is the height of the bottle?\\
